## Project Description:
I had to push my GitHub file from a remote to a local repository, where I then highlighted five key points from this lesson and added pictures which suited my topics.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. GitHub is an extremely important resource that helps users communicate and work efficiently.
2. The two types repositories are local and remote. Local repositories are for individual users while remote repositories are for multiple users. 
3. Without version controlled systems, working on files and projects would be a lot harder because if one messed with a single function, they wouldn't be able to revert to their previous state.
